"""Integration test for anthropic-sdk-python repository analysis.

This test validates that the static test infrastructure analyzer correctly
analyzes the anthropic-sdk-python repository and assigns a score in the
expected range of 20-25/35 points.

Test Coverage:
- Detects tests/ directory with pytest files (FR-001)
- Finds pyproject.toml with [tool.pytest] section (FR-005)
- Calculates test_file_ratio correctly (FR-010)
- Final score in range 20-25 points (FR-013)

IMPORTANT: Uses REAL repository cloning (no mocks), as per project requirements.
