# Research: Smoke Test Implementation

**Feature**: End-to-End Smoke Test Suite
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

All technical requirements are well-defined from existing codebase analysis. No external research needed as the smoke test leverages existing infrastructure and standard Python testing patterns.

## Technology Decisions

### Testing Framework
- **Decision**: pytest
- **Rationale**: Already used throughout the codebase, UV-managed dependency
- **Alternatives considered**: unittest (built-in but less flexible), custom script (unnecessary complexity)

### Process Execution
- **Decision**: subprocess.run()
- **Rationale**: Standard Python library, reliable for shell script execution
- **Alternatives considered**: os.system() (deprecated), shell=True with security risks

### File Validation
- **Decision**: pathlib.Path.exists()
- **Rationale**: Modern Python standard, cross-platform compatibility
- **Alternatives considered**: os.path.exists() (older API), glob matching (unnecessary complexity)

### Target Repository
- **Decision**: git@github.com:AIGCInnovatorSpace/code-walker.git
- **Rationale**: Specified in user requirements, known stable repository
- **Alternatives considered**: Local test repository (requires maintenance), multiple repositories (increased complexity)

## Implementation Patterns

### Smoke Test Structure
Based on existing test patterns in codebase:
- Test module location: `tests/smoke/test_full_pipeline.py`
- Use pytest fixtures for setup/teardown if needed
- Clear assertion messages for debugging failures
- Timeout handling for long-running pipeline execution

### Error Handling Strategy
Following KISS principle from constitution:
- Immediate failure with descriptive messages
- No complex error recovery mechanisms
- Clear distinction between pipeline failures vs. validation failures

### Output Validation
Verify three expected artifacts:
1. `output/submission.json` - Metrics collection results
2. `output/score_input.json` - Checklist evaluation results
3. `output/evaluation_report.md` - Human-readable report

## Integration Points

### Existing Infrastructure
- `scripts/run_metrics.sh` - Main pipeline execution script
- UV dependency management - No additional dependencies required
- Existing output directory structure - Reuse standard locations

### Configuration Requirements
- Use existing script parameters: `--enable-checklist --generate-llm-report=false`
- Set working directory to project root for relative path resolution
- Standard pytest discovery and execution patterns

## Performance Considerations

### Execution Time
- Full pipeline typically completes in 2-5 minutes for test repository
- Timeout recommendation: 10 minutes maximum to handle network/tool variability
- No need for optimization as this is validation, not performance testing

### Resource Usage
- Minimal additional overhead beyond normal pipeline execution
- Temporary files cleaned up by existing pipeline cleanup mechanisms
- No persistent state or caching requirements

## Validation Strategy

### Success Criteria
1. Pipeline script exits with zero return code
2. All three expected output files exist
3. Files contain valid content (basic format validation)

### Failure Scenarios
1. Pipeline execution failure (non-zero exit code)
2. Missing output files (incomplete pipeline)
3. Malformed output files (pipeline corruption)

## Dependencies Analysis

### Required Dependencies
- pytest (existing, UV-managed)
- subprocess (Python standard library)
- pathlib (Python standard library)
- os (Python standard library for environment setup)

### External Dependencies
- Git (required for repository cloning - existing requirement)
- All existing code-score analysis tools (existing requirement)
- Network access for repository cloning (existing requirement)

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Repository URL is hardcoded (no user input validation needed)
- Script path is relative to project root (no path injection risk)
- No sensitive data handling in smoke test

### Execution Environment
- Runs in same environment as existing tests
- No elevated privileges required
- Temporary directory usage follows existing patterns

## Research Conclusions

Implementation is straightforward with no complex decisions required. All unknowns have been resolved through existing codebase analysis. Ready to proceed to design phase.
