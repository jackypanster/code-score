# Feature Specification: End-to-End Smoke Test Suite

**Feature Branch**: `001-1-smoke-tests`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "建议的最小方案：

  1. 新增一个极简 smoke 脚本
     在 tests/smoke/run_full_pipeline.py 里就干两件事：
      - 调用 subprocess.run(["./scripts/run_metrics.sh", "git@github.com:AIGCInnovatorSpace/code-walker.git", "--enable-checklist", "--generate-llm-report=false"])，并把 cwd 指向项目根目录；
      - 成功后 assert output/submission.json、output/score_input.json、output/evaluation_report.md 均存在。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **development team member**, I want to run a simple smoke test that validates the entire code analysis pipeline works correctly, so that I can quickly verify system health before releases or after making changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the code-score system is installed and configured, **When** I run the smoke test against a known repository, **Then** the system should successfully generate all expected output files (metrics, evaluation, and report)
2. **Given** the smoke test completes successfully, **When** I examine the output directory, **Then** all required files should exist with valid content structure
3. **Given** the smoke test encounters an error in the pipeline, **When** the test runs, **Then** it should fail clearly and provide meaningful error messages for debugging

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the target repository is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle when individual analysis tools are missing?
- What occurs if the output directory doesn't have write permissions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a smoke test that validates the complete analysis pipeline from repository input to final outputs
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute the full metrics collection and checklist evaluation workflow using a real repository
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify that all expected output files are generated successfully after pipeline completion
- **FR-004**: System MUST use a reliable, publicly accessible repository for consistent test results
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear pass/fail results with descriptive error messages when validation fails
- **FR-006**: System MUST run independently without requiring manual setup or external dependencies beyond the existing toolchain
- **FR-007**: System MUST complete execution within reasonable time limits to support quick validation workflows

### Key Entities
- **Smoke Test**: A lightweight validation script that exercises the full system pipeline and verifies expected outputs
- **Target Repository**: A known, stable public repository used as test input for consistent validation results
- **Output Artifacts**: The collection of files produced by the pipeline including metrics data, evaluation results, and human-readable reports
- **Validation Results**: Pass/fail status with detailed information about what succeeded or failed during testing
