# Feature Specification: Parameterized Git Repository Metrics Collection

**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-git-workflow`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "理解这个项目的背景 @docs/ , 先落地第一步，目前第一步就要做成"通用公共 Git 仓库"输入：先实现一个可参数化的采集+基础度量脚本/Workflow，接受 repo_url（与可选 commit_sha），默认拿 git@github.com:AIGCInnovatorSpace/code-walker.git 做回归验证。这样后续换任意公开仓库都能直接跑 checklist，MVP 也能快速在多项目上试用。建议先完成下列动作：- 定义入口脚本/CLI（例如 ./scripts/run_metrics.sh <repo> [commit]），负责克隆仓库、切换提交。- 在脚本里根据语言触发 lint/test/coverage/audit，并把结果落成 JSON/Markdown（metrics/*.json, submission.json）。- 先对 code-walker 运行验证，确认输出结构和失败回退逻辑，再推广到其他公共仓库。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a hackathon organizer, I need to automatically evaluate code quality across multiple participant repositories with consistent metrics, so that I can provide fair and objective scoring without manual review overhead.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a public Git repository URL, **When** I run the metrics collection script, **Then** the system clones the repository and generates comprehensive quality metrics in standardized JSON/Markdown format
2. **Given** a repository URL with a specific commit hash, **When** I execute the collection workflow, **Then** the system switches to that exact commit before running metrics analysis
3. **Given** the default test repository (code-walker), **When** I run the validation script, **Then** the system produces expected output structure and gracefully handles any failures

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the repository URL is invalid or inaccessible?
- How does the system handle repositories with no recognizable programming language?
- What occurs when lint/test/coverage tools fail or are not available for the detected language?
- How does the system respond to network timeouts during repository cloning?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a repository URL as a mandatory parameter
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept an optional commit SHA parameter to analyze specific versions
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically detect the primary programming language of the target repository
- **FR-004**: System MUST clone the specified repository to a temporary working directory
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute language-appropriate static analysis tools (lint, test, coverage, security audit)
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate structured output in both JSON and Markdown formats
- **FR-007**: System MUST store metrics results in organized directory structure (metrics/*.json, submission.json)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide graceful error handling and failure recovery mechanisms
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate successfully against the default repository (git@github.com:AIGCInnovatorSpace/code-walker.git)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multiple programming languages (TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, Python, Golang)
- **FR-011**: System MUST clean up temporary files and directories after execution
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear progress indicators and logging during execution

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Repository**: Git repository with URL, optional commit hash, detected language, and analysis results
- **Metrics Collection**: Container for all collected quality metrics including lint results, test coverage, security audit findings
- **Output Format**: Standardized JSON/Markdown structure containing repository info, metrics data, and execution metadata
- **Language Detector**: Component that identifies primary programming language and selects appropriate toolchain
- **Tool Executor**: Component that runs language-specific analysis tools and captures results
