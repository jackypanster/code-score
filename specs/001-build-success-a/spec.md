**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "构建检测完整接入
  - 目标：所有语言的build_success字段正确填充

    a. Python: 添加python -m build或uv build检测
    b. JavaScript: 添加npm run build或yarn build检测
    c. Go: 接入现有go build ./...到metrics output
    d. Java: 接入现有mvn compile/gradle compileJava到metrics output
  - 成功标准：submission.json中build_success不再为null"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

2. Extract key concepts from description
   → ✓ Identified: Build detection, validation status, multi-language support
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No critical ambiguities identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✓ Primary workflow: Automated build validation during repository analysis
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✓ 7 testable requirements defined
6. Identify Key Entities
   → ✓ Build validation results, error details, language configurations
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✓ No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **code quality assessment system user**, I want the system to automatically detect and validate the build status of target repositories across all supported programming languages, so that I can comprehensively evaluate code quality including build health without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Python project repository with build configuration, **When** the analysis runs, **Then** the system should validate whether the project builds successfully and record the result as true/false
2. **Given** a JavaScript/TypeScript project with build scripts, **When** the analysis runs, **Then** the system should detect and execute the build validation, recording the outcome
3. **Given** a Go project with buildable source code, **When** the analysis runs, **Then** the system should verify the build compiles successfully and capture the status
4. **Given** a Java project with Maven or Gradle configuration, **When** the analysis runs, **Then** the system should execute build validation and document success or failure
5. **Given** a project where build validation fails, **When** the analysis completes, **Then** the system should record detailed error information to help diagnose issues
6. **Given** a project where build tools are unavailable, **When** the analysis runs, **Then** the system should gracefully handle the missing tools and record appropriate status

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a project has multiple build configurations (e.g., both npm and yarn)?
- How does the system handle projects with incomplete or invalid build configurations?
- What occurs when build validation times out due to slow or hanging builds?
- How does the system behave when build tools exist but return unexpected output formats?
- What happens when a project requires specific environment variables or external dependencies for building?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and validate build status for Python projects, determining if the project can be successfully built
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect and validate build status for JavaScript and TypeScript projects, verifying successful compilation/bundling
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and validate build status for Go projects, confirming the source code compiles without errors
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect and validate build status for Java projects, checking whether Maven or Gradle builds complete successfully
- **FR-005**: System MUST record build validation results in the metrics output with explicit true/false status (never null/undefined)
- **FR-006**: System MUST capture detailed error information when build validation fails, including error messages and failure reasons
- **FR-007**: System MUST gracefully handle missing or unavailable build tools by recording status as "tool unavailable" rather than failing the entire analysis
- **FR-008**: System MUST complete build validation within reasonable time limits to prevent analysis pipeline delays
- **FR-009**: System MUST support detection of multiple build tool options per language (e.g., npm vs yarn, maven vs gradle) and select appropriately

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Build validation MUST complete within 2 minutes per project to maintain overall analysis performance
- **NFR-002**: Build error messages MUST be truncated if exceeding 1000 characters to prevent output bloat while preserving diagnostic value
- **NFR-003**: Build validation MUST not modify the target repository or leave artifacts in the cloned directory

### Key Entities
- **Build Validation Result**: Represents the outcome of attempting to build a project, with values: success (true), failure (false), or tool unavailable (null with reason)
- **Build Error Details**: Contains diagnostic information when builds fail, including error messages, exit codes, and failure timestamps
- **Language Build Configuration**: Metadata about detected build systems for each supported language, including tool names and configuration file paths
- **Build Validation Status**: Overall state tracking for build validation process, indicating whether validation was attempted, succeeded, failed, or skipped

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
- **Metric 1**: 100% of analyzed repositories have `build_success` field populated with non-null values in `submission.json`
- **Metric 2**: Build validation accuracy ≥95% when compared to manual verification
- **Metric 3**: Build validation completes within timeout limits for ≥99% of projects

### Validation Method
- Analyze a diverse set of 20+ repositories across all 4 supported languages
- Verify `build_success` field is populated with boolean values (not null)
- Compare automated results against manual build attempts
- Measure validation duration to ensure performance requirements met

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Existing tool runner infrastructure for each language (Python, JavaScript, Go, Java)
- Build tool availability on analysis execution environment (may be optional)
- Repository cloning and language detection functionality already operational

### Assumptions
- Build configurations follow standard conventions for each language ecosystem
- Build processes do not require interactive input or GUI interaction
- Build validation can be performed in isolated environments without network access (for most projects)
- Projects using non-standard build systems are acceptable edge cases and may return "tool unavailable"

---

## Out of Scope
- Custom or proprietary build system support beyond standard ecosystem tools
- Build optimization or performance improvement for target repositories
- Build artifact collection or caching
- Multi-stage or complex CI/CD pipeline simulation
- Build reproducibility verification across different environments
- Dependency resolution or version management beyond basic build execution
