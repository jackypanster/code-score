# Research: Checklist Mapping & Scoring Input MVP

## Overview
Research conducted for implementing checklist evaluation system that bridges raw metrics collection and LLM-powered scoring for automated hackathon evaluation.

## Technology Decisions

### JSON Schema Validation
**Decision**: Use `jsonschema` library for validating input submission.json and output score_input.json formats
**Rationale**:
- Existing dependency in project ensures consistency
- Provides robust validation with clear error messages (supports KISS principle)
- Industry standard for JSON validation
- Fail-fast validation aligns with constitutional principles
**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom validation logic (rejected: reinventing wheel, more complex)
- Pydantic validation only (rejected: less precise for complex nested structures)

### Data Modeling Approach
**Decision**: Use Pydantic v2 models for internal data structures with JSON Schema for I/O validation
**Rationale**:
- Pydantic already in dependencies, consistent with existing codebase
- Type safety and auto-completion support
- Built-in serialization/deserialization
- Clear data model documentation through type hints
**Alternatives considered**:
- Plain dictionaries (rejected: no type safety, harder to maintain)
- dataclasses (rejected: less feature-rich than Pydantic)

### Evaluation Logic Architecture
**Decision**: Simple rule-based evaluation with explicit mapping functions
**Rationale**:
- KISS principle: straightforward logic easier to debug and maintain
- Each checklist item has clear evaluation criteria from ai-code-review-judgement.md
- Explicit evidence tracking supports auditability requirements
- Easy to extend for future checklist changes
**Alternatives considered**:
- Rule engine framework (rejected: over-engineering for 11 items)
- Plugin architecture (rejected: premature abstraction)

### Evidence Tracking Strategy
**Decision**: Structured evidence references with JSON paths and human-readable descriptions
**Rationale**:
- Supports audit trail requirements from specification
- JSON path notation provides precise data location references
- Human-readable descriptions support manual verification
- Enables debugging and validation of scoring decisions
**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple string descriptions only (rejected: insufficient precision)
- Raw data embedding (rejected: increases output size unnecessarily)

### Error Handling Pattern
**Decision**: Fail-fast with specific exceptions for critical errors, graceful degradation for partial data
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for fail-fast behavior
- Critical errors: malformed JSON, missing submission.json file
- Graceful degradation: missing individual metrics (mark as unmet with clear reasoning)
- Specific exception types enable targeted error handling
**Alternatives considered**:
- Silent failure handling (rejected: violates constitution)
- Complex recovery mechanisms (rejected: violates KISS principle)

### Output Format Design
**Decision**: Structured JSON with mandatory fields and optional extensions
**Rationale**:
- Machine-readable for LLM processing (Phase 3 requirement)
- Human-readable with clear field names and descriptions
- Extensible structure for future enhancements
- Consistent with existing submission.json format patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- YAML output (rejected: JSON more universal for API integration)
- Binary format (rejected: not human-readable)

## Integration Points

### Existing Metrics Pipeline
**Research findings**:
- Current submission.json structure well-defined in output/submission.json
- Existing schema covers code_quality, testing, documentation sections
- Need to map these to 11-item checklist systematically
- Language-specific metric variations already handled

### CLI Integration
**Research findings**:
- Existing Click-based CLI in src/cli/main.py
- Consistent pattern for adding new subcommands
- Need new `evaluate` command to process existing submission.json
- Should integrate with existing output directory structure

### Testing Strategy
**Research findings**:
- Existing pytest framework with good separation (unit/integration/contract)
- Contract tests validate JSON schemas effectively
- Integration tests use real sample data
- Need to create test fixtures for various scoring scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- JSON processing and validation (well-established patterns)
- Pydantic model definitions (straightforward data structures)
- File I/O operations (simple read/write patterns)

### Medium Risk Items
- Language-specific evaluation logic (requires careful testing across all 4 languages)
- Evidence reference accuracy (need precise mapping to source data)
- Edge case handling (partial data scenarios need thorough coverage)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive test coverage for all 11 checklist items
- Test with real submission.json files from multiple languages
- Clear documentation of evaluation criteria and edge cases
- Modular design enables isolated testing of components

## Performance Considerations

### Expected Performance Profile
- Target: <5 seconds for typical submission.json files
- Bottlenecks likely in JSON parsing and rule evaluation
- Memory usage should be minimal (streaming not required for hackathon scale)

### Optimization Opportunities
- Lazy evaluation of checklist items (evaluate only what's needed)
- Caching of repeated calculations (if applicable)
- Parallel evaluation of independent checklist items (future enhancement)

## Dependencies Analysis

### Required New Dependencies
- None - all required libraries already in project dependencies
- jsonschema: already present
- pydantic: already present
- click: already present

### UV Dependency Management
- All additions will use `uv add` command per constitution
- Development dependencies via `uv add --dev` for test-specific libraries
- No pip or conda usage permitted

## Compliance Verification

### Constitutional Alignment
- ✅ UV-based dependency management: No new external dependencies required
- ✅ KISS principle: Simple rule-based evaluation, no complex abstractions
- ✅ Transparent communication: Clear evidence tracking and reasoning

### Feature Specification Alignment
- ✅ All 12 functional requirements addressable with chosen approach
- ✅ Key entities mappable to Pydantic models
- ✅ Edge cases handleable with graceful degradation strategy
- ✅ Multi-language support through language-aware evaluation logic
