## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13
- Q: When Phase 1 static analysis already achieved 25 points and Phase 2 CI analysis detects 13 points of evidence, what should the final Testing dimension score be? ‚Üí A: 35 points (simple truncation) - take min(25+13, 35) = 35, excess discarded
- Q: When CI configuration analysis completes, what level of diagnostic information should the system generate? ‚Üí A: Configurable logging (default standard level) - records detected CI platforms, matched test steps, coverage tools, and parse failure warnings; supports CLI parameter to switch to minimal or detailed modes
- Q: How should Phase 2 CI analysis results be stored in the final output data? ‚Üí A: Independent parallel structure - create top-level `test_analysis` object containing `static_infrastructure` and `ci_configuration` as sibling fields, allowing Phase 1/Phase 2 to evolve independently while aggregation layer consumes both datasets and applies capping logic

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a code quality evaluator, when I analyze a Git repository, the system should automatically detect CI/CD configurations and extract evidence of automated testing practices to provide a more accurate quality score, without requiring me to manually inspect workflow files or run any code.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a repository with GitHub Actions workflows containing test steps, **When** the system analyzes the repository, **Then** the testing score increases by 5 points and the evaluation report shows "CI includes automated test execution"

2. **Given** a repository with GitLab CI configuration that uploads coverage to Codecov, **When** the system analyzes the repository, **Then** the testing score increases by 10 points (5 for tests + 5 for coverage) and evidence references the specific CI file and upload step

3. **Given** a repository with multiple test jobs (unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests) in CircleCI config, **When** the system analyzes the repository, **Then** the testing score increases by 13 points (5 + 5 + 3) and the report lists all detected test job types

4. **Given** a repository without any CI configuration files, **When** the system analyzes the repository, **Then** the CI analysis contributes 0 points and gracefully continues to use the baseline static analysis score from Phase 1

5. **Given** a repository with Travis CI configuration that contains build steps but no test commands, **When** the system analyzes the repository, **Then** the CI analysis contributes 0 points and logs "CI configuration found but no test steps detected"

6. **Given** a repository where Phase 1 static analysis scored 25 points and Phase 2 CI analysis detects full 13 points, **When** the system calculates the final Testing dimension score, **Then** the score is capped at 35 points (not 38) and the report shows both phase contributions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a CI configuration file exists but is malformed or unparseable?
  - System logs a warning, contributes 0 CI score, and continues with Phase 1 static score

- What happens when test commands are embedded in shell scripts referenced by CI (e.g., `run: ./scripts/test.sh`)?
  - Phase 2 MVP detects direct test commands only; script-wrapped tests may be missed but won't cause failures

- What happens when a repository has multiple CI platforms configured (e.g., both GitHub Actions and CircleCI)?
  - System analyzes all detected CI platforms and uses the highest score achieved from any platform

- What happens when CI configuration uses matrix strategies or conditional test execution?
  - System counts each unique test job name regardless of matrix dimensions to avoid double-counting

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**CI Platform Detection**
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect GitHub Actions workflow files in `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `.github/workflows/*.yaml`
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect GitLab CI configuration in `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect CircleCI configuration in `.circleci/config.yml`
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect Travis CI configuration in `.travis.yml`
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect Jenkins configuration in `Jenkinsfile`
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle repositories with no CI configuration without causing analysis failure

**Test Step Extraction**
- **FR-007**: System MUST identify test execution steps containing commands: `pytest`, `python -m pytest`, `npm test`, `npm run test`, `go test`, `mvn test`, `gradle test`, `./gradlew test`
- **FR-008**: System MUST distinguish test steps from build, lint, or deployment steps
- **FR-009**: System MUST count the number of distinct test jobs across all detected CI platforms
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle CI configurations with no test steps without causing analysis failure

**Coverage Upload Detection**
- **FR-011**: System MUST identify Codecov upload actions or commands (e.g., `codecov/codecov-action`, `codecov upload`)
- **FR-012**: System MUST identify Coveralls integration steps
- **FR-013**: System MUST identify SonarQube scan steps
- **FR-014**: System MUST detect coverage report generation flags in test commands (e.g., `--cov`, `--coverage`)

**Scoring Logic**
- **FR-015**: System MUST award 5 points when at least one test execution step is detected
- **FR-016**: System MUST award 5 additional points when coverage upload or reporting is detected
- **FR-017**: System MUST award 3 additional points when 2 or more distinct test jobs are detected (indicating separation of unit/integration/E2E tests)
- **FR-018**: System MUST cap the total CI analysis score contribution at 13 points
- **FR-019**: System MUST calculate the final Testing dimension score as min(Phase1_score + Phase2_score, 35), truncating any excess above 35 points (e.g., 25 + 13 = 35, not 38)

**Performance and Safety**
- **FR-020**: System MUST complete CI configuration analysis in under 1 second per repository
- **FR-021**: System MUST NOT execute any code from the target repository
- **FR-022**: System MUST handle parse errors in CI configuration files gracefully without failing the entire analysis

**Evidence and Transparency**
- **FR-023**: System MUST record the CI platform name for each detected configuration
- **FR-024**: System MUST record the file path of each analyzed CI configuration
- **FR-025**: System MUST record the specific test commands and coverage tools detected
- **FR-026**: System MUST include CI analysis findings in the evaluation evidence report
- **FR-027**: System MUST support configurable logging levels (minimal, standard, detailed) with standard as default, where:
  - Minimal: final score and CI platform names only
  - Standard: detected platforms, test step count, coverage tools, parse failure warnings
  - Detailed: all parse steps, command matching process, execution time, relevant file content excerpts
- **FR-028**: System MUST structure output data as a top-level `test_analysis` object containing independent `static_infrastructure` (Phase 1) and `ci_configuration` (Phase 2) sibling fields, plus `combined_score` and `score_breakdown` for final aggregation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

  - `ci_configuration`: Phase 2 CI configuration analysis results (CIConfigResult)
  - `combined_score`: Final Testing dimension score after applying min(Phase1 + Phase2, 35) capping logic
  - `score_breakdown`: Detailed breakdown showing Phase 1 contribution, Phase 2 contribution, and any truncated excess

- **CIConfigResult**: Represents the analysis outcome for a single repository's CI/CD configuration

  - Configuration file path
  - Test step detection flag (boolean)
  - List of detected test commands
  - Coverage upload detection flag (boolean)
  - List of detected coverage tools
  - Count of distinct test jobs
  - Calculated score contribution (0-13 points)

- **TestStepInfo**: Represents a single test execution step found in CI configuration
  - Job or step name

  - Test framework inferred (e.g., "pytest", "jest", "JUnit")
  - Presence of coverage flags
